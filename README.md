#### A way to dynamically load mods in Risk of Rain 2

## How do I install this?

#### The first thing you **MUST DO** is rename `Risk Of Rain 2_Data/Plugins/AkHarmonizer.dll` to `AkHarmonizer_Original.dll`

After the first step, build or download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/meepen/ror2-modloader/releases/latest) and drag the files into your `Risk of Rain 2`.

To install mods afterwards, just place them in your `Mods` folder in `Risk of Rain 2`!
